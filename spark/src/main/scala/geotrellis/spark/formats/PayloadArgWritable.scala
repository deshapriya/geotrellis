/*
 * The PayloadArgWritable is a variant of ArgWritable wherein you can store not just the RasterData 
 * but also a "payload", which is any Writable object.
 * 
 * The apply variants handle the serialization - i.e., going from a RasterData and a Writable payload 
 * to a PayloadArgWritable
 * 
 * The toPayloadRasterData handles the deserialization - going from an existing PayloadArgWritable to 
 * a RasterData (the return value) and a payload (mutable argument passed in). The latter is passed in
 * instead of returned, since the typical use case is iterating over some RDD of PayloadArgWritables, 
 * and getting both the RasterData and payload out. The user can then create the Writable object once 
 * and inside the loop iterating over the RDD, pass it into the toPayloadRasterData. This avoids creating
 * Writable objects inside the method
 * 
 * There is a convenience implicit in the package object that wraps toPayloadRasterData  
 *
